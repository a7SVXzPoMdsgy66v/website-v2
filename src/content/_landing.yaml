      Throughout a year, we never touch on the same topic twice. We've done workshops on web development, 
      machine learning, and so much more before, and our workshops every year only get better! Plus, if 
      you want to learn something new, just reach out to our committee members and we might just work 
      together to bring your topic to the masses.
